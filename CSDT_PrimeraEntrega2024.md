# Overall Results 📈

The project has shown significant improvements in various areas, including code quality, testing coverage, and overall maintainability. I successfully identified and addressed code smells, refactored the codebase to improve readability and maintainability, and implemented unit tests for the service layer. The integration tests have been updated to provide more comprehensive coverage, and the project now includes Sonarcloud and GitHub Actions integrations to monitor code quality and automate the build process.
The result of each activity is summarized below:
1. **Code Smells and Refactoring 📝:** Identified and addressed code smells in the project, including poor separation of concerns, naming conventions, and magic numbers. Refactored the codebase to improve readability and maintainability.
2. **Clean Code and XP 🧽:** Identified clean code practices and XP values in the project, focusing on simplicity, readability, and maintainability. The codebase now follows some consistent naming conventions, clear structure, and proper documentation.
3. **Testing Debt 🧪:** Addressed testing debt by implementing unit tests for the service layer and updating integration tests for the controller layer. The project now has improved test coverage and clear testing strategies.
4. **Quality Models (Sonarcloud + GH Actions) 🚀:** Integrated Sonarcloud and GitHub Actions to monitor code quality, identify code smells, and automate the build process. The project now has a better overview of code quality and maintainability.
