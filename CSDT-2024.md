# First Activity (Code Smells and Refactoring)

## Code Smells

### Controllers
- **Bad Separation of Concerns**: The `CreateAccountController`, `SuggestionController`, and `AuthenticationController` classes show a violation of the Single Responsibility Principle by combining controller, business logic, and data access code.

- **Naming Conventions**: Non-descriptive variable naming (i.e. `EntityManager em` or `PasswordEncoder pe`).

- **Magic Numbers/String**: Direct use of "5", "10", and "UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY" in [CreateAccountController.java](src%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Foutout%2Fcontroller%2FCreateAccountController.java).

- **Authentication Failure Response**: Returning HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND in [AuthenticationController.java](src%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Foutout%2Fcontroller%2FAuthenticationController.java) for failed authentication may lead to confusion.

### Auth
- **Poor or Incomplete JWT Information**: [StatelessAuthenticationFilter.java](src%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Foutout%2Fsecurity%2FStatelessAuthenticationFilter.java) lacks proper validation and information in JWT Tokens.

### Tests
- **Lack of Service and Repository Tests**: The absence of tests for service and repository classes indicates a gap in test coverage.

- **Basic Test Descriptions and Coverage**: Existing tests lack descriptive names and cover only limited scenarios.

## Refactoring Techniques 

### Controllers
- **Single Responsability Principle**: implement business logic and data access code from controllers and placing them in separate service and repository classes.

- **Improve Naming Conventions**: Refactor variable names to follow consistent and descriptive naming conventions, improving code readability.

- **Replace Magic Number with Symbolic Constant**: Replace magic numbers and strings with constants or enums to enhance code maintainability and understanding.

- **Follow HTTP Status code Standard**: Adjust the HTTP status code in [AuthenticationController.java](src%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Foutout%2Fcontroller%2FAuthenticationController.java) to use more appropriate codes like HttpStatus.UNAUTHORIZED or HttpStatus.FORBIDDEN.

### Auth
- **Enhance JWT Token**: Improve the JWT Tokens in [StatelessAuthenticationFilter.java](src%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Foutout%2Fsecurity%2FStatelessAuthenticationFilter.java) by adding necessary user information and ensuring proper validation.

### Tests
- **Add Service and Repository Tests**: Develop tests for service and repository classes to verify their functionality.

- **Improve Test Descriptions and Coverage**: Enhance test descriptions and expand coverage to include a broader range of scenarios for more thorough testing.

# Second Activity (Clean Code Principles and XP)

## Clean Code Principles

As part of the refactoring process, the following Clean Code principles will be checked in the codebase to ensure the quality of the code:

### SOLID Principles
- The project doesn't adhere to the **Single Responsibility Principle**, as the controllers ([SuggestionController.java](src%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Foutout%2Fcontroller%2FSuggestionController.java),[CreateAccountController.java](src%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Foutout%2Fcontroller%2FCreateAccountController.java),[AuthenticationController.java](src%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Foutout%2Fcontroller%2FAuthenticationController.java),) contain business logic and data access code.
  - **Recomendations:** Move the business logic and data access code to separate service and repository classes.
- The project doesn't adhere to the **Open/Closed Principle**, there is nothing to be extended without modifying the existing code, as the controllers are directly dependent on the service and repository classes.
  - **Recomendations:** After decoupling service and data access code from the controllers, we can re-define the architecture to use  interfaces to allow services or data logic available for extension in case its needed.
- The project doesn't adhere to the **Liskov Substitution Principle**, as there are no clear inheritance relationships in the codebase (everithing is coupled in controller layer).
  - **Recomendations:** We can define a clear inheritance relationship in the service and repository classes, and use interfaces to allow the services (AccountService, RestaurantService) or data (AccountRepository, RestaurantRepository) logic to be substituted without affecting the client code. 
- The project doesn't adhere to the **Interface Segregation Principle**, as there are no clear interfaces in the codebase.
  - **Recomendations:** We can define clear interfaces for the service and repository classes to ensure that the client code is not forced to depend on interfaces that it does not use, specifically in the repository classes, we can define a clear interface for the repository layer to ensure that the code is not forced to depend on specific DB implementations.
- The project doesn't adhere to the **Dependency Inversion Principle**, because the controllers are directly dependent on the service and repository classes not using any dependency injection.
  - **Recomendations:** We can use dependency injection to invert the dependency between the controllers and the service and repository classes, and use the previosly defined interfaces to allow the services or data logic to be substituted without affecting the client code. 

### DRY Principle
- The codebase contains duplicated code in the controllers, which can be refactored to adhere to **the Don't Repeat Yourself** principle i.e [SuggestionController.java](src%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Foutout%2Fcontroller%2FSuggestionController.java) we can see some repeated query logic and data treatment.

### YAGNI Principle
- The codebase does not contain any clear violations of the **You Aren't Gonna Need It** principle, all the imports and methods are being used (excluding some getters and setters that are defined in case of project extension).

### KISS Principle
- The codebase contains some complex methods and classes that can be refactored to adhere to the **Keep It Simple, Stupid** principle, i.e [StatelessAuthenticationFilter.java](src%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Foutout%2Fsecurity%2FStatelessAuthenticationFilter.java) contains complex logic that can be simplified using **Spring Security**, in [CreateAccountController.java](src%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Foutout%2Fcontroller%2FCreateAccountController.java) we can see how we manage some logic that validates some user data that can be validated in the model layer, when we are creating the user (constructor level).

## XP (Extreme Programming)

In my personal opinion, the following XP practices will be implemented in the project to improve the development process:

### Pair Programming
- The project might benefit from **Pair Programming** to improve code quality, knowledge sharing, and collaboration among team members 
### TDD (Test-Driven Development)
- **TDD** might be implemented to ensure that the code is thoroughly tested and that the tests are written before the code is implemented, however, the project already has some tests, but they are not covering all the scenarios and are over a bad design.
### Continuous Integration
- **Continuous Integration** might be implemented to ensure that the code is integrated and tested frequently, and that any issues are identified and resolved early in the development process.
### Coding Standards
- **Coding Standards** will be established to ensure that the code is consistent and maintainable, and that all team members are following the same conventions and best practices.
  - **Code Reviews**: Regular code reviews will be conducted to ensure that the code adheres to the established coding standards and best practices, and that any issues are identified and resolved early in the development process. (in this case, to ensure this, the code will be developed by me as student but asynchronously reviewed by teacher)
