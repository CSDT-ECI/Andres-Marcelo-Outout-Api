# CSDT Final Delivery - Refactoring Outout API

This is the final delivery of the project for the 2024 semester. The project is an API that allows users to review restaurants and get suggestions based on their preferences.

## Purpose of the Project ✨

Given a project with a **high level of technical debt**, the main purpose of this project is to refactor the codebase to improve code quality, maintainability, and test coverage. The project aims to address code smells, improve the overall structure of the codebase, and implement unit tests for the service layer. The project also focuses on integrating Sonarcloud and GitHub Actions to monitor code quality and automate the build process.

## Whats Inside 📦
